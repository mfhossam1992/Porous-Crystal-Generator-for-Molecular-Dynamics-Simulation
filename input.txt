# LATTICE_CONSTANT is a constant that represents the lattice constant of the crystal

LATTICE_CONSTANT = 3.6

# NUM_LATTICE_ATOMS is a constant that represents the approximate desired number of substitutional atoms in the lattice

NUM_LATTICE_ATOMS = 100

# POROSITY is a constant that represents the desired porosity of the supercell

POROSITY = 0.1

# INCLUDE_CARBON is a bool to decide whether to include interstitial carbon atoms or not

INCLUDE_CARBON = True

# PORE_CONFIGURATION_INDEX is an integer that represents the index of the pore configuration to select

PORE_CONFIGURATION_INDEX = -1

# The pore configurations are sorted in descending order of number of pores. 
# Index 0 is the largest number of pores, each of size 1 atom.
# Index 1 is the second largest number of pores, and so on.
# Index -1 is the smallest number of pores, which is one big pore.
